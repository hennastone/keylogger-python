## What is a Keylogger?

A keylogger is an insidious form of spyware. You enter sensitive data onto your keyboard, believing nobody is watching. In fact, keylogging software is hard at work logging everything that you type.

Keyloggers are activity-monitoring software programs that give hackers access to your personal data. The passwords and credit card numbers you type, the webpages you visit – all by logging your keyboard strokes. The software is installed on your computer, and records everything you type. Then it sends this log file to a server, where cybercriminals wait to make use of all this sensitive information.

## Two types of keyloggers

Some keyloggers are hardware devices embedded within your internal PC hardware. They also come as a form of a plug placed between the CPU box and keyboard cable in an inconspicuous manner. In either case, someone will have to physically plant the hardware into your PC or its peripherals. This will require a  degree of secrecy if it needs to be achieved clandestinely.

The second type of keyloggers are software that can be easily installed on victims’ devices. While this software is a type of malware, it is “good” malware, wherein it doesn’t harm its host. Its sole job is to snoop into the keystrokes and not impact the computer. You merrily go about your business, while undetectable keyloggers start stealing personal or sensitive data, without you ever knowing.

## Legal keylogging examples

The legal use of keyloggers depends on user consent (depending on local laws), whether they’re used maliciously to steal personal information, who owns the devices they’re installed on, and whether the use victimizes someone in a manner that breaks any other applicable law. Here are a few examples of potentially legal keylogging: 

* User experience data monitoring
* Parental control to monitor and protect children’s online activity
* Recording usage on a personal device owned by the keylogger user
* Network, software, or hardware troubleshooting
* Company data exchange and search query monitoring
* Devise-use monitoring by a company or public entity, such as a library
* Any legal usage consented to via a user agreement or contract 

## Illegal keylogging examples

Illegal keylogging gets tricky because sometimes potentially legal usage can straddle the line between unethical and illegal. Generally speaking, the use becomes illegal primarily when it leads to stolen confidential data or when software/hardware is installed on a device owned by someone else, as outlined below: 

* Account information theft
* Collection of sensitive information
* Monitoring when consent was explicitly denied via a legally binding contact
* Credit card information and PIN collection
* Installation of software or hardware on someone else’s device
* Keystroke monitoring of a public device
* Unlawful stalking or voyeurism 

# Installation and Usage

Paste the following code to your terminal of choice in whichever directory you want:

`git clone https://github.com/hennastone/keylogger-python.git`

Run keylogger.py and until you press ESC the program will record every keystroke and generate log file in your directory
